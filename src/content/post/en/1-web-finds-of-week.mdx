The web have a lot of stuff. Quantitative, more shitty than good or useful stuff. That's why I'm making a weekly series compiling content on the web, old and just released, that I think is worth sharing. This way I find a way to propagate a more personal, human curation of content in place of any black-boxed automated algorithm focused on user engagement.

# Music

Expect to always have music content in this series. Today there'll be a lot of varying eletronic music plus an awesome psychedelic rock band with strong groovy energy.

Eletronic music have many subgenres, as it's pretty much just a collection of different tools and resources that rely on, guess what, eletronic stuff. Pop, Rap, Metal and probably all of current non-acoustic music have synthetic sounds and effects in its final product. So on this blog you'll probably see how liking eletronic can mean anything regarding music style. I'm not saying

## It came from the 80's Vol.9

<VideoFrame id="hyv3J6n4yxE" />

**What's about:** A Retro Darkwave Horror Synth Special.

There is this genre of eletronic music called, in more board terms, retrowave, that tries to bring what the beginning of eletronic effects and synthesizers have built in the mainstream music in the 80's. This genre can have even more subterms that specifies all the ways you can interpret the nostagic styles from that time, mixed with current ways to produce music. The Darkwave Horror term refers to a dark, energetic and progressive beats you could literally listen in a horror action film. For this set, you'll definitively feel like inside a 80's horror or action dystopian movie.

This Youtube channel is also **great**. It has many full sets of a great curation of music of a wide range of different eletronic subgenres. This set is the nineth of a 8 years old series of this syle of darkwave. The channel Reality Breaks (previously called "Confused bi-product of a misinformed mind") is not the biggest channel in town but it has a consistently amazing content and it should be more known to people. Go subscribe to it!

## DJ Erpeto - Reptal Disease

<VideoFrame id="7SmFMabpm7w" />

**What's about:** Dj Erpeto's 2nd instrumental album. A beattape from the greek record label KNKUC.

From deep and dark beats with violent drums, to slow and mysterous dub beats, this album presents many hip-hop and beyond beats that greatly fits to listen while I code. It's really interesting how the whole album share the same horror vibe. Leaving clues of some deeper story about, as the album says, a reptal disease.

## System108 Podcast - RLGN

<VideoFrame id="SejNHHUCDxw" />

**What's about:** A russian underground techno podcast, guesting RLGN.

The russian techno scene is very rich with its experimental and hard music. One of the names I've been seeing a lot on my youtube is RLGN. As described on his unofficial [genius bio page](https://genius.com/artists/Rlgn), _RLGN is a Moscow based DJ & producer. An integral member of the pioneering FOREVER PUNK community and a graduate of the labels PRIVATE PERSONS, TRAM Planet, Electro Music Coalition, NO SERVICE & Don’t Recordings_.

This episode is actually many sets in different ambients, from beautiful nature hills to an almost literal night club inside a dormitory. You'll get to listen from drums and bass to hard techno and even brazilian funk! The experimental mashup of stuff is all about making a non-stop banger.

**What's about:** A podcast about software development. In this special two part episode. The hosts read many of the community stories developers submited when they faced "spooky" situations having to fix bugs immediatelly on production or realizing errors on the project that could mean the end of their job (or even worse conclusions).

Lessons learned:

- DO NOT UPDATE WITHOUT WHERE;
- Do not deploy on fridays; 
- Consistently check your backups and its automated process execution (and don't store it in the same machine as your current data!);
- Be aware if you're working in a local/test enviroment or in production;
- DO NOT deploy on fridays!;

## Zen Browser

<Carousel>

![minimal layout](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zen-browser/www@latest/public/browsers/image2.png)

![split layout](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zen-browser/www@latest/public/browsers/image4.png)

</Carousel>

**What's about:** A firefox based web browser that aproach its layout in a opinionated but very thoughful way. In any regard to its default layout, the browser is still super customizable for the style you prefer.

Some of you tech and productivity nerds might already have heard of this new browser called Arc. It's currently stable only for mac and it presents itself as a rethought experience for browsing the web. Stacked tabs on the left as a sidebar, management of profiles for different collection of tabs, split view for pages and much more. Zen Browser is the open-source firefox alternative to this approach. 

It doesn't have literally all the features Arc has, however for it current alpha release, it's a good enough browser to become my main one. The fullscreen layout is great for smaller laptop screens, the tabs left sidebar is good to better use my wide monitor aspect ratio. It's serving as a good alternative to do everything expected in any browser, plus extra useful new features.
