The web has a lot of stuff. Quantitative, more shitty than good or useful stuff. That's why I'm making a weekly series compiling content on the web, old and just released, that I think is worth sharing. This way I find a way to propagate a more personal, human curation of content in place of any black-boxed automated algorithm focused on user engagement.

# Music

Electronic music has many subgenres, as it's pretty much just a collection of different tools and resources that rely on, guess what, electronic stuff. Pop, rap, metal, and probably all of current non-acoustic music have synthetic sounds and effects in their final product. So on this blog, you'll probably see how liking electronic can mean anything regarding music style.

## It came from the 80's Vol.9

<VideoFrame id="hyv3J6n4yxE" />

**What's about:** A Retro Darkwave Horror Synth Special.

There is this genre of electronic music called, in more broad terms, retrowave, that tries to bring what the beginning of electronic effects and synthesizers have built into mainstream music in the 80's. This genre can have even more subterms that specify all the ways you can interpret the nostalgic styles from that time, mixed with current ways to produce music. The Darkwave Horror term refers to dark, energetic and progressive beats you could literally listen to in a horror action film. For this set, you'll definitely feel like inside a 80's horror or action dystopian movie.

This Youtube channel is also **great**. It has many full sets of a great curation of music of a wide range of different electronic subgenres. This set is the ninth of a 8 years old series of this syle of darkwave. The channel Reality Breaks (previously called "Confused bi-product of a misinformed mind") is not the biggest channel in town but it has consistently amazing content and it should be more known to people. Go subscribe to it!

## DJ Erpeto - Reptal Disease

<VideoFrame id="7SmFMabpm7w" />

**What's about:** Dj Erpeto's 2nd instrumental album. A beattape from the greek record label KNKUC.

From deep and dark beats with violent drums, to slow and mysterious dub beats, this album presents many hip-hop and beyond beats that greatly fits to listen while I code. It's really interesting how the whole album shares the same horror vibe. Leaving clues of some deeper story about, as the album says, a reptal disease.

## System108 Podcast - RLGN

<VideoFrame id="SejNHHUCDxw" />

**What's about:** A russian underground techno podcast, guesting RLGN.

The russian techno scene is very rich with its experimental and hard music. One of the names I've been seeing a lot on my youtube is RLGN. As described on his unofficial [genius bio page](https://genius.com/artists/Rlgn), _RLGN is a Moscow based DJ & producer. An integral member of the pioneering FOREVER PUNK community and a graduate of the labels PRIVATE PERSONS, TRAM Planet, Electro Music Coalition, NO SERVICE & Don‚Äôt Recordings_.

This episode is actually many sets in different ambients, from beautiful nature hills to an almost literal night club inside a dormitory. You'll get to listen from drums and bass to hard techno and even brazilian funk! The experimental mashup of stuff is all about making a non-stop banger.

## A evid√™ncia mais estranha do Cristianismo Antigo

<VideoFrame id="tvkSe0A-ccg" />

**What's about:** An analysis on one of the oldest (and weirdest) pieces of evidence of christianism.

What if I told you that one of the oldest depictions of Jesus and Christianity was actually making fun of it. That's right. One of the oldest registries of christianism is by some dude mocking another dude, saying he's now decided to become christian. Even weirder, Jesus is depicted in a way you're definitely not used to. The dude is not only saying the guy is christian, but also into **onolatry**. I'll let you find out by yourself what that means through the video üëÄü´è.

**This channel is simply great**. Hist√≥ria Estranha presents many specific facts or answers to intriguing questions we don't even stop to think about: [what's the take of christianism about alien life (during all its history)](https://youtu.be/sQ-5KOYVTuQ?si=7NbLRT9iLUBHNCgy)? [How was the **religion** of the old greeks](https://youtu.be/AlnLVqb9bgw?si=1uhx7oVySY-Uad7s), beyond only the mythos lore? Did they go the their "church" weekly or some ritual like that? [Were the poor mummified in old egypt?](https://youtu.be/GXtslzh6rcE?si=gmiSJgxJ0-aUyPFc), and [and **how** were they differently mummified?](https://youtu.be/wPyxbjd84po?si=N6z6VcwNoVLBQKsO). [**WHEN** was it decided which year would be the **year one** of the birth of Jesus Christ](https://youtu.be/2gI5jhGEAlU?si=I6kmwWLmdAUXlTQ6). Ok. I think you people got the idea, I mean, how the f#Ã¶ÃÉÕ´#ÃìÕ§ÕìkÃàÃÅÃ¨ÃàÃÅ can't you be interested to at least one of these subjects, huh? Check his channel and you'll probably, just by the title, find something you'll want to learn about.

The host, bachelor, master and doctor in History at UFMG, Henrique Caldeira, reaches many topics of history but you'll see his specialty on religion and western history. One possible outcome to extract from his videos, as you progressively see how every so called eternal beliefs are actually shaped and changed by so many external powers like politics, war and just pure internal corrupted interest, is that there is no such a thing as an unquestionable religion. Doesn't matter how much you want to prove your old superior belief is right, there is 100% chance you'd be considered a sinner/enemy some hundred and even decades ago from the same religion you are now aggressively defending.

My point is not that your religion is not worth believing. My point is that nothing gives you the permission to impose your belief as the only right and valid. To be intolerant and not able to change could actually mean the opposite of being a good believer. For millennia, philosophers, high religious authorities, popes and emperors, writers and translators have been discussing how to define and choose what's the divine word, whatever if its to better comprehend life and deal with the universe or to control the masses, and YOU think you know how your religion is whats need to solve all the problems?? Feels like you wanna get the role of god and establish what's good for everyone, huh?

Humbleness sums up what can be exercised as you watch his videos. You realize that you carry just a tiny slice of the ways the humanity has thought about god and beyond, and to think that your **exact** way of thinking, with strict rules, is really up to solving the problems of the world? A world you don't even see with your individual even smaller perspective as you scroll through your twitter feed? I just feel like that's the most egocentric perspective somebody could ever have. Quite the opposite of what Jesus Christ, right? Humbleness not only puts ourselves into perspective on how small we are, but how deep the knowledge and philosophy is to deal with humanity. To be open to others perspective is to be open to what the others may god and the beyond universe have to show you its answers.

**What's about:** A podcast about software development. In this special two part episode. The hosts read many of the community stories developers submitted when they faced "spooky" situations having to fix bugs immediately on production or realizing errors on the project that could mean the end of their job (or even worse conclusions).

Lessons learned:

- DO NOT UPDATE WITHOUT WHERE;
- Do not deploy on fridays;
- Consistently check your backups and its automated process execution (and don't store it in the same machine as your current data!);
- Be aware if you're working in a local/test environment or in production;
- DO NOT deploy on fridays!;

## Zen Browser

<Carousel>

![minimal layout](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zen-browser/www@latest/public/browsers/image2.png)

![split layout](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zen-browser/www@latest/public/browsers/image4.png)

</Carousel>

**What's about:** A firefox based web browser that approaches its layout in an opinionated but very thoughtful way. In any regard to its default layout, the browser is still super customizable for the style you prefer.

Some of you tech and productivity nerds might already have heard of this new browser called Arc. It's currently stable only for mac and it presents itself as a rethought experience for browsing the web. Stacked tabs on the left as a sidebar, management of profiles for different collections of tabs, split view for pages and much more. Zen Browser is the open-source firefox alternative to this approach.

It doesn't have literally all the features Arc has, however for it current alpha release, it's a good enough browser to become my main one. The fullscreen layout is great for smaller laptop screens, the tabs left sidebar is good to better use my wide monitor aspect ratio. It's serving as a good alternative to do everything expected in any browser, plus extra useful new features.
