**What it's about:** A channel of a ball maker.

This craftsman specializes in making soccer balls. Just like the classic hexagonal shape texture of the ball you know, this artist actually craft incredible other shapes covering the balls and experimenting on funny concepts like an orange peel and prototyping textures inspired by other plastic artist from other fields. A great example of how design can be creative in any context.

## Stranger Danger - Bridge Kids

<VideoFrame id="DPPfYPwVOVw" />

**What it's about:** An adult comedy web series on YouTube of two kids in twisted situations, in a weird neighborhood with weird funny characters.

This animated webseries, produced by Mike Carf and Adam Mickiewicz, features two boys, Fugger and Lars, living in this very twisted neighborhood as they deal with situations in very naive and funny ways. The first episode started as a 48h challenge animation project, where the two characters are showed for the first time under a bridge, giving the series its name. The series didn't gain much visibility right of the bat, and the production isn't that frequent as it remains a side project for the animators. But from the seventh episode, the series gets to the millions of views. I was also caught in that wave and met the series from this exact ep shown in the post.

The humor of the series thrives on the dialogue of the characters and the bizarre nature of the situations they find themselves in. It's funny on how absurd it can be and at the same time, the stereotyped characters feel very relatable to people we know. Other more frequent characters make part of the series, including Moe and Skid who are presented kinda as antagonists and are a personal favorite from the series.

## I Made a Graph of Wikipedia... This Is What I Found

<VideoFrame id="JheGL6uSF-4" />

**What it's about:** A video of a guy who created a map of all the linked articles in the English Wikipedia.

In this video, you have the oportunity to visualize the size of wikipedia but most of all, see how the data is related together. The narrator (aka adumb) describes how, through graph algorithms, the whole english wikipedia, made of more than 6 million articles, can be grouped in 44 communities, each united by how their articles are linked to one another. Not only does it become clear how these grouped articles share similarities with each other, but you'll also see group and individual behaviors that don't seem too obvious. The rest of many insights and questions raised by that map can be seen more in the video in a very clear and visually engaging format.

**What it's about:** An art form that mashes together music and it's sound waves in a visual experience.

An [oscilloscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscilloscope) is an equipment designed to show signal waves of any kind, like sound. What if there were artists creating electronic music that also displays cool images on the oscilloscope?

That's what Jerobeam Fenderson, Chris Allen and other artists are creating and making available on their youtube channel. They live in a niche but extremely interesting form of media, having its own ways to express art and stories. And I mean stories. If music wasn't enough to be able to tell a story, oscilloscope music gives an extra layer to work on each beat played, and show a scene of a ongoing movie clip. While Jerobeam goes to a more abstract and psychedelic visuals, Chris also invest in some extra detailed shapes. For the music part, expect some techno from the synthetic beats that fits perfectly with the cyberpunk vibe.

**What it's about:** A channel of an audiophile who clearly and objectively reviews a wide range of headphones and music related tech.

The youtube channel of Leonardo Drummond is the go-to place if you want to rely on honest and practical reviews of audio gear. The great thing is that he makes sure to to check very popular products and even very cheap ones. If its wasn't enough to review many different products, he makes a public spreadsheet available of all the products reviewed in his channel, organized by categories, listed by his recommendation priority, containing price, full review video link, national and international buying link and key details to consider when buying the headphone.
