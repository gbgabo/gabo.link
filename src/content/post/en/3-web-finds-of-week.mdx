**What's about:** A channel of a ball maker.

This hand crafter has the specialty of making soccer balls. Just like the classic hexagonal shape texture of the ball you know, this artist actually craft incredible other shapes covering the balls, experimenting on funny concepts like an orange peel and prototyping textures inspired by other plastic artist of other fields. Such a good example on design being creative on anything.

## Bridge Kids

<VideoFrame id="DPPfYPwVOVw" />

**What's about:** An adult comedy webseries on youtube of two kids in twisted situations, in a weird neighborhood with weird funny characters.

This animated webseries, produced by Mike Carf and Adam Mickiewicz, have as the main characters these two boys, Fugger and Lars, living in this very twisted neighborhood as they deal with situations in very naive and funny ways. The first episode started as a 48h challenge animation project, where the two characters are showed for the first time under a bridge, giving the series its name. The series didn't catch a big visibility right of the bat, and the production isn't that frequent as it's moved as a side project from the animators. But from the seventh episode, the series gets to the millions of views. I was also caught in that wave and met the series from this exact ep shown in the post (Stranger Danger).

The humor of the series lives on the dialogs of the characters and the bizarre nature of the situations they find themselves in. It's funny on how absurd the it can be and at the same time, the esteriotiped characters feel very relatable to people we know. Other more frequent characters make part of the series, including moe and skid who are presented as antagonists and are a personal favorite from the series.

**What's about:** An art form that mashes together music and it's sound waves in a visual experience.

An [oscilloscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscilloscope) is an equipament designed to show signal waves of any kind, like sound. What if there were artists creating eletronic music in which also show cool images on te oscilloscope?

That's what Jerobeam Fenderson, Chris Allen and some other artists are creating and making available on their youtube channel. They live in a niche but extremelly interesting form of media, having its on ways to express art and stories. And I mean stories. If music wasn't enough to be able to tell a story, oscilloscope music gives an extra layer to work on each beat played, and show a scene of a ongoing movie clip. While Jerobeam goes to a more abstract and psichedelic visuals, Chris also invest in some extra detailed shapes, including telling more contiuous sequences of video. For the music part, expect some techno from the synthetic beats that fits perfectly with the cyberpunk vibe.
