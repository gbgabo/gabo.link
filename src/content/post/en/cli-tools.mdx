<p class="px-6">The terminal can be an uncomfortable and unproductive environment if you are not familiar with the tools it offers. It's not only interesting to know the native tools of a Linux system, such as those from the GNU project but also the additional tools you can install to make your daily life in the terminal easier. This post's list presents tools that not only add agility to the terminal but also offer a richer visual experience for the text screen. They are useful for both beginners and those who already have autonomy but may not be familiar with some of the items below.</p>

**Good for:** Managing multiple terminal sessions, visual window management.

[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) is a terminal multiplexer. In other words, it allows you to manage multiple terminal sessions through command line and keyboard shortcuts. It's useful for handling more than one session in the same terminal, managing sessions through windows, sending open sessions to the background, and in general, providing a user-friendly interface to navigate between open processes in the terminal. It makes even more sense when you are limited to accessing a remote machine only via SSH. Tmux will give you much more freedom.

Tmux supports plugins that allow you to extend the program with functions like predefining window layouts (tmuxinator) for different project environments and restoring the previous layout even after restarting the machine (tmux-continuum).

**Good for:** Rendering useful icons through the command line.

[Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) are not a program but a package of icons provided as text fonts. There are over 9,000 included icons that, when used as one of your terminal fonts, allow you to view icons in the command line, making programs visually richer. To facilitate their use, these icons are made available by combining them with another text font you use, such as UbuntuMono, Fira Code, Hack. This way, you only need to set the text font you chose, and the icons will already be included in the terminal.

# 3. zsh

**Good for:** Enhancing the command line experience through plugins.

[Zsh](https://zsh.org) is a command interpreter, just like Bash. What makes it famous is the community-developed plugins, especially by the Oh My Zsh project, to make your daily life in the terminal easier. Things like auto-complete, themes, and extensions for a richer prompt, git integrations, and built-in aliases.
