  Currently we have access to tools that enable new and improved ways to create, interact and experience the real and digital world.
  
  The level of power current software offer made being creative and productive a matter of mastering the tools we have available right now.
  
  This page is created to show the tools I use to code, write and everything included in a web developer cozy setup. It's inspired by [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/), a website created by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses) in which incentivises developers and creators to share their own configurations in a page like this one.
